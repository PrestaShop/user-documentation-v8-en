# Contributing to the documentation

Just like PrestaShop itself, the [documentation](https://docs.prestashop-project.org/) is open to everyone for suggestions, ideas, and modifications. Anyone is welcome and even encouraged, to contribute to **translate**, **update**, or **write** the PrestaShop 8 user documentation.

GitBook and GitHub are synchronized: if you change the content of any page on GitBook, your edits will be pushed to the GitHub repository. Conversely, commits pushed to GitHub are imported on GitBook.&#x20;

This means that both interfaces are open to contributions.

### Contributing on GitBook <img src=".gitbook/assets/image (53) (2).png" alt="" data-size="line">

Gitbook is a tool to build documentation. It works like a text editor and might be the best solution if you are not really tech-savvy. To contribute to the PrestaShop documentation using GitBook, please send us an email to **documentation@prestashop.com** with a little introduction of yourself:

Are you a merchant? In which language would you like to translate, update, or write? What motivates you to participate in this project?

PrestaShop's Product Content Manager will onboard you and will give you access to the documentation as an editor. You will have to sign in with either a Gmail, GitHub, or GitBook account. Click here to[ create a GitBook account](https://app.gitbook.com/join).

### Contributing on GitHub <img src=".gitbook/assets/image (54) (1).png" alt="" data-size="line">

Each documentation is synchronized with a repository on GitHub. Both interfaces are open to contributions. Click on your language to visit the corresponding repository: [English ](https://github.com/PrestaShop/user-documentation-en), [French ](https://github.com/PrestaShop/user-documentation-fr), [Spanish ](https://github.com/PrestaShop/user-documentation-es), [Italian ](https://github.com/PrestaShop/user-documentation-it), [Dutch ](https://github.com/PrestaShop/user-documentation-nl), [Farsi](https://github.com/PrestaShop/user-documentation-fa).

#### Opening an issue

An idea, a suggestion? Let the community know by submitting a [new issue](https://github.com/PrestaShop/user-documentation-en/issues)!

This is a ticket-tracker for the user documentation repository and it is the best place to write a suggestion or request an improvement. For that, you will just need a GitHub account.

#### Editing a file&#x20;

This option is particularly adapted if you are not used to working on GitHub yet.

1. Create your GitHub account, if you do not have one already.
2. Browse to the target file.
3. Click the "Edit" button and make your changes in the editor.â€Œ
4. Once you are done, go to the bottom of the page, enter a name and a description and click on "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request".
5. Finally, click on "Propose file change". GitHub will automatically create a new fork and branch on your own GitHub account, then suggest a pull request to this repository.
6. Once the pull request is submitted, just wait for the Product Content Manager to come back to you.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please do not commit your changes directly to the master branch. It is important to create a pull request so that your work can be proofread first.
{% endhint %}

#### Forking the project

This option is particularly adapted if you already work on GitHub or if you feel comfortable doing so.

1. Create your GitHub account, if you do not have one already.
2. Fork this repository to your Github account.
3. Clone your fork to your local machine.
4. Create a branch in your local clone for your changes.
5. Change the files in your branch.
6. Push the changed branch to your fork in your GitHub account.
7. Create a pull request for your changes. If you need help to make a pull request, read the GitHub help page about[ creating pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
8. Wait for the Product Content Manager to either include your changes in the codebase or comment on possible adjustments.

Once you have chosen the way to contribute that suits you best, you are ready to participate in the PrestaShop open source project. Thank you for your contribution!&#x20;
