PrestaShop is very easy to uninstall:

1. Delete all of PrestaShop's files and folders on your web server, using your FTP client.
2. Delete all the `ps_` tables from PrestaShop's database, using phpMyAdmin.

You will lose all information registered to your store: customers, orders, invoices, products, etc.\
This cannot be undone unless you have proper backups of all your data.
