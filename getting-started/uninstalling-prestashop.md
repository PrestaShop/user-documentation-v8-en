# Uninstalling PrestaShop 8

PrestaShop is very easy to uninstall:

1. **Delete all of PrestaShop's files** and folders on your web server, using your FTP client.
2. **Delete all the `ps_` tables** from PrestaShop's database, using phpMyAdmin.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**You will lose all information registered to your store: customers, orders, invoices, products, etc.**

\
This cannot be undone! Make sure you have a proper backup of all your data.
{% endhint %}
