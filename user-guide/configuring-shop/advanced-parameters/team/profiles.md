# Profiles

PrestaShop enables you to assign specific duties and rights to each employee who helps you manage the online shop. For example, the administrator will have access to the entire store, without restriction, while an employee can only have access to the catalog or orders.

By default, PrestaShop has 4 profiles ready to use:

* **SuperAdmin**. The highest rank. It has all the rights and can access everything on the PrestaShop installation.
* **Logistician**. Those in charge of packing and sending orders. Can only access the orders, shipping and stock management pages, and part of the catalog and customer pages.
* **Translator**. Those who are tasked in translating your shop's textual content. Can access products and categories, content pages and the "Translations" page.
* **Salesman**. Your salespersons, if any. In addition to the translator's access rights, can also access the customer pages, the modules and webservice, and some stats.

You can see the details of the access rights by reviewing each profile in the "Permissions" page.

The SuperAdmin profile cannot be deleted, only renamed.

There should be at least one employee with a SuperAdmin profile.

You can add as many profiles as needed.

Adding a new profile is pretty straightforward: simply click the "Add new profile" button, enter a unique name for the new profile, and save.

The more complex part comes when setting the new profiles access rights. This is done in the "Permissions" page.
