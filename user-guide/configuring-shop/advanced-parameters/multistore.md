# Multistore

This page is only available when you enable the multistore feature.

Turning your single-shop PrestaShop installation into a multi-shop one is very simple:

1. Go to the "Shop Parameters" menu and select the "General" page.
2. Find the "Enable Multistore" option, select "Yes".
3. Save your changes.

The "Advanced Parameters" menu will now feature the "Multistore" page, which is presented in details in the "Managing multiple shops" chapter of this guide.
