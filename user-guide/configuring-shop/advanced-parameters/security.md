# Security

## Back office token protection

The token protection helps **secure access to your back office by using tokens**.&#x20;

When this feature is enabled, each URL becomes specific to a customer's session, and cannot be used as-is on another browser, thus protecting any information they might have stored during that session.

By default, back office token protection is **enabled.**

### Configure the password policy & password strength indicator

The **password policy** menu allows you to configure your store's password policy by choosing between 5 increasing levels of complexity. This will allow you to decide how strict you want to be about user passwords.&#x20;

Passwords are rated from **0** (Extremely guessable) to **4** (Very unguessable) based on their security score. The minimum and maximum length of passwords can be set manually.

When creating an account, front office users receive real-time cues of their chosen passwordâ€™s strength according to the back office password policy. A color-coded cue _â€“_ as well as a tooltip _â€“_ will help them understand if their password is strong enough.

_**Note:** themes must be updated to support this feature. See_ [#themeandlogo-yourcurrenttheme](../../improving-shop/customizing-store-design/theme-and-logo.md#themeandlogo-yourcurrenttheme "mention")

| Cue color | Password length | Password strength |
| :-------: | :-------------: | :---------------: |
|     ðŸŸ¥    | Not long enough | Not strong enough |
|     ðŸŸ§    | Not long enough |       Strong      |
