# Configuring your shop

The "Configure" section enables you to configure and fine-tune some of your shop's details. These include a lot of different aspects of the shop, from technical settings to the customer's shopping experience. Therefore, all of these parameters should be carefully examined, and you should consider each option, as enabling or disabling any of them can have a real impact on your shop, and ultimately, your sales.

This chapter contains the following sections:

* [Configuring your Shop Parameters](shop-parameters/)
* [Configuring Advanced Parameters](advanced-parameters/)
