# Configuring your store

The "Configure" section enables you to configure and fine-tune some of your store's details. These include a lot of different aspects of the store, from technical settings to the customer's shopping experience. Therefore, all of these parameters should be carefully examined, and you should consider each option, as enabling or disabling any of them can have a real impact on your store, and ultimately, your sales.

This chapter contains the following sections:

* [Configuring your Shop Parameters](shop-parameters/)
* [Configuring Advanced Parameters](advanced-parameters/)
