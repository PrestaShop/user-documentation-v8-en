# Modules Selection

The “Selection” tab is about discovering new modules and service to improve your store. Here you’ll find a list of all the modules you can install (and not the ones you’ve already installed).

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/51185191 (5) (10) (7).png>)

This selection of recommended modules is based on your country, language, and version of PrestaShop. It includes the most popular modules from our Addons marketplace and free partner modules.

What is the difference between a module and service?

**A module** allows you to add features to your shop such as new means of payment, a synchronization of inventory and orders with your logistician, an export to smart shopping guides, and many tools for you and your customers. Modules come with a file that must be installed within your PrestaShop.

On the other hand, **a service** is intangible: you do not have to install anything on your shop for the service to work. Instead, you may have to sign a contract with the service provider. Services are identified with the "Discover" button.

## Searching for a module or service <a href="#modulesselection-searchingforamoduleorservice" id="modulesselection-searchingforamoduleorservice"></a>

If you have a specific need and are looking for a module to help you, there are two ways to search for a module:

* **Browse the categories**. By clicking on "Categories" you will find a list of categories: modules are organized in functional categories, depending on how you want to improve your shop. Do you want to improve its navigation or are you rather interested in implementing some new marketings actions? Once you're done with categories, select "All categories" to reset the selection.
* **Use the search bar**. If you have a specific need in mind you can also type keywords in the search bar, on the right-hand side of the page. For example, if you type in "newsletter", you will find all the modules and services related to newsletters. You can also search modules by module name, or author. To remove a keyword, click on its cross.To reset the search, click on the blue cross at the far right of the bar.

You can use both the search bar and the categories simultaneously, to further narrow down your results.

If your search doesn't give any results, a link invites you to go to Addons marketplace where you will find more modules.

### Filtering modules <a href="#modulesselection-filteringmodules" id="modulesselection-filteringmodules"></a>

In addition to the search, you can also sort modules to better find what you need, with these filter:

* **Name**. Sort modules by their name, from A to Z.
* **Increasing price**. Show modules with the lowest price first. Free modules will be shown at the top of the list, sorted from A to Z.
* **Decreasing price**. Show modules with the highest price first.
* **Popularity**. Sort modules and services according to their rating on Addons. Built-in modules will be displayed first as they do not have any rating available on Addons.\

What is a built-in module?

Built-in (or native) modules are available within your shop from its set-up. Some are already pre-installed to help your shop running (you will find them in the "Installed modules" tab), while other are available in the "Selection" tab. You can choose to install it or not, depending on your needs. They cover the basics of e-commerce and come for free.

### Displaying results <a href="#modulesselection-displayingresults" id="modulesselection-displayingresults"></a>

There are two options to choose from to display the list of modules.

* **Card view**. Each module is displayed in a card, providing more space for information display.
* **List view**. Each module is displayed in a row, allowing to display more modules at the same time. You will find the same information as the card view, except for the popularity

By clicking on "Read more" you will find more details on each module or service.

### Modules and service information <a href="#modulesselection-modulesandserviceinformation" id="modulesselection-modulesandserviceinformation"></a>

Each module comes with a set of information to guide you in your choice.&#x20;

* **Module name.** The name for the module.
* **Module author**. The author of the module.&#x20;
  * "By PrestaShop" is used for both built-in modules or for modules made by PrestaShop and sold on Addons marketplace.&#x20;
  * "By PrestaShop partners" identifies modules developed by PrestaShop's institutional partners, and they often come for free.&#x20;
  * "By Community developer" includes individual contributors or agencies from the PrestaShop community whose modules are available on Addons.
* **Module version**. The version of the module you would be installing.
* **Short description**. A short sentence to describe the module or service's purpose, and how it can help you
* **Popularity**. The rating of the module as available on Addons (out of five stars) and the number of ratings.

#### **Read more** <a href="#modulesselection-readmore" id="modulesselection-readmore"></a>

If the basic information is not enough for you to make a decision, you can click on "Read more" to have more details. A pop-up will open, with an image for the module (its icon or sometimes a screenshot) and several tabs. This information is provided by the module's author, therefore they can vary from one module to another in term of both quantity and quality.

* **Overview**. A short description of the module.
* **Additional information**. More detailed information.
* **Benefits**. What the module will bring to your shop.
* **Features**. Which features you can expect from the module.
* **Demo video** (optional). A short video presenting the module.
* **Changelog** (optional). A list of the novelties from the module's last version. What has been improved or added.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/51185197 (3) (4).png>)

At the bottom of the pop-up window, some badge can appear:

* **Made by PrestaShop**. This module has been developed by the PrestaShop team.
* **Official Partner**. This module has been developed by a PrestaShop Partner or Partner agency.
* **PrestaShop's Favorite**. These modules have been rewarded by the PrestaShop team as particularly simple and useful modules!

## Installing or purchasing a module <a href="#modulesselection-installingorpurchasingamodule" id="modulesselection-installingorpurchasingamodule"></a>

When you have chosen the module you need, depending on the type of module it is, you can perform three different kinds of actions.

* **Install it**. Free modules have an "Install" button. By clicking it, the module will get installed in your shop. Once installed, a new menu will appear to manage your module : you can configure, uninstall, disable, disable on mobile, or reset the module. Read more about these options in the "Installed Modules" section.
* **Purchase it**. For paying modules, instead of "Install", the button will display the price of the module. By clicking it, you will be redirected to the Addons page for the module, where you can complete the purchase. Don't forget to tie your shop to your Addons account to automatically retrieve the module in your shop!
* **Discover it**. Services display a "Discover" button. By clicking it, you will be redirected to the Addons page for the service, where you can subscribe to the service.

When you have installed a module, you will find it in the list of modules from the "Installed modules" tab, which is the next chapter.

## Uploading a module manually  <a href="#modulesselection-uploadingamodulemanually" id="modulesselection-uploadingamodulemanually"></a>

Once you have downloaded a module from the Addons online shop to your computer, it is up to you have it installed on your PrestaShop site.

If you haven't linked you store to your Addons account, there are two ways to install a module: either using the dedicated form or using your FTP client.

#### Installing using the upload form <a href="#modulesselection-installingusingtheuploadform" id="modulesselection-installingusingtheuploadform"></a>

To install a new PrestaShop module automatically, click on the "Upload a module" button at the top of the page. A pop-up window will open.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/51185188 (4) (2) (3).png>)

This block enables you to upload the archive file of the module, as downloaded from Addons. You can either upload a `zip` file, or a `tar.gz` one (tarball). Simply drop the module's file here, or browse to the file that you downloaded by clicking on "select file". Do not point to the module's uncompressed folder or any of its unpacked files: only the archive file!&#x20;

Once the file is detected, the installation will start automatically: PrestaShop will upload the module from your computer to its server, unpack it, place the files in the correct location, and update the page, all this in a handful of seconds. PrestaShop will then display "Module installed!".

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/51185193 (6) (9) (7).gif>)

Modules are not installed by default: you still have to click the module's "Install" button, and then possibly configure its settings via the "Installed modules" tab.

Once the configuration is complete, be sure to test the module immediately to confirm that it works as planned.

#### Installing using an FTP client <a href="#modulesselection-installingusinganftpclient" id="modulesselection-installingusinganftpclient"></a>

You can also choose to install a module by yourself, using an FTP client.

To install a new PrestaShop module manually:

1. Unzip (decompress) the module archive file (`.zip` or `tar.gz`). This should result in a new folder.
2. Using your FTP client, connect to PrestaShop web server, and place the unpacked module folder in PrestaShop's `/modules` folder.\
   Pay attention NOT to upload that folder in another module's folder (which can happen when drag-and-dropping items). Upload both the folder and the files it contains, not just the files.
3. Go to your back office, in the "Selection" tab.
4. Locate the new module in the modules list. You might have to scroll down; you can also use the list's search engine, which should give you a dynamically updated list of matching module names.
5. In the row for the new module, click the "Install" button.
6. Your module is now installed and should be activated too. If necessary, click on the module's "Configure" link. Also, pay attention to any warning message that might be displayed by PrestaShop.

Once the configuration is complete, be sure to test the module immediately to confirm that it works as planned.

Modules can come from many sources, and not all of them are reliable. This is why PrestaShop sometimes displays a warning window for "Untrusted" modules – that is, modules that have not been verified by PrestaShop through its Addons marketplace. This screen window lets you choose whether to proceed with the installation with no further notification or to stop the installation process.

Installing a native module or a module obtained through Addons will not trigger the display of this window.

## Connecting to Addons Marketplace  <a href="#modulesselection-connectingtoaddonsmarketplace" id="modulesselection-connectingtoaddonsmarketplace"></a>

PrestaShop Addons is the central marketplace where you can get new modules and themes for your store. Addons users are first-class citizens when it comes to managing modules! Indeed, once your installation of PrestaShop is tied to your Addons account, the modules you get on Addons will automatically be imported and updated! This is why it is highly recommended that you should link your store to your PrestaShop Addons account.
