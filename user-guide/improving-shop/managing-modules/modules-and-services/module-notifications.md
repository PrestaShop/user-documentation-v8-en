# Module notifications

It is important to keep your modules up-to-date, whether some setting is missing or a new version is available. This page helps you review the actions you need to perform on concerned modules.

Modules to configure

You will at times get notifications from installed modules. Most of the time, the notification help you complete the configuration of modules that are installed but are not yet ready to be used: updating their settings should make the notification disappear... and your module work properly.

When one of your modules has an update available on the Addons site, PrestaShop will let you know about it, and an "Update" button will appear. Click on this button to update your modules. Before updating your module, you can have a look at its changelog to review what's new with this new version. It is useful to check your modules after the update: are these new features working properly?
