# Modules and Services

In PrestaShop 1.7 the Modules and Services page is divided into three tabs to help you perform easily what you want to do regarding your modules:

* Selection: this is where you can discover and install new modules to improve your store when youâ€™re beginning or growing with PrestaShop,
* Installed Modules: where you can manage your modules on a daily basis,
* Notifications: review modules notifications, when you need to take action (updates or configuration) to guarantee the good functioning of your modules.

At the top of the page, you will also find two important features: the connection to Addons and the "Upload a module" option.

Follow the links for more details on these tabs:

* [ Modules Selection](modules-selection.md)
* [ Installed modules](installed-modules.md)
* [ Module notifications](module-notifications.md)
