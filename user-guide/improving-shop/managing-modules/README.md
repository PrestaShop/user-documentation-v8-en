# Managing your Modules

PrestaShop comes with a set of modules that can be installed/uninstalled and configured as desired, in order to customize and complete your shop.

The range of actions is virtually unlimited: the extensibility of PrestaShop makes it possible to turn your shop into exactly what you intend it to do, instead of you having to comply with constraints that you did not choose â€“ provided you can find the module that does exactly what you need.

This chapter contains the following sections:

* [Modules and Services](modules-and-services/)
* [Modules Catalog](module-catalog.md)

The "Modules" section of the back office is currently being reworked. Changes are expected from PrestaShop 1.7.5 to the next minor versions, and that is why we would rather not document it right now but wait for the whole rework to be over. Don't panic, as we want it to remain intuitive, you probably won't need help!
