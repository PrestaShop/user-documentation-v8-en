# Localization

**Localization is the adaptation of software content from one specific language or culture into another one.**&#x20;

This means that components specific to locales (such as languages, currencies, or units of measurement) are entirely adapted and translated in your store, providing customers with a localized store that best fits their needs.

This localization section is about making sure your shop is adapted to your target markets. If you are targeting a specific country, you need to support its language, its currency, etc.
