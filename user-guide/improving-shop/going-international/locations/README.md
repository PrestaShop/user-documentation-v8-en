# Locations

Locations are the geographical zones (states, countries, or even bigger zones including many countries) that are used for shipping. It's important it should be accurate, and that all the regions you want to deliver to should be included and enabled in these pages.

This section contains the following chapters:

* [Countries](countries.md)
* [Zones (EN)](zones.md)
* [States](states.md)
