# Managing Discounts

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/51839844 (5) (5).png>)

Discounts and vouchers play an important role in your daily relationships with your customers. Typically, customers like two things when shopping:

* Feeling special, unique.
* Getting good prices.

Both can be achieved with customized discounts, and this is precisely where vouchers come into play â€“ or more precisely, price rules.

"Price rules" can take two forms:

* **Cart rules**. It enables you to create per-customer voucher codes, but also much more.
* **Catalog price rules**. Enables you to assign price reductions by category, brand, supplier, attribute or feature.\
  \
  For instance, you can set a rule that would say that Spanish customers belonging to the "Good clients" group would get 10% off on your electronics category and all Sony products for the first week of July.
