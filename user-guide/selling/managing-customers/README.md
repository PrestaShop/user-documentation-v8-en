# Managing your Customers

You have to take good care of your customers and it starts with making sure their profile contains all the information you need to have a package shipped to them.

The "Customers" menu enables you to check on your customers' details and addresses.

The settings for anything customer-related are in the "Shop Parameters" menu, on the "Customer settings" page.

This chapter contains the following sections:

* [Your customers](your-customers.md)
* [Customer addresses](customer-addresses.md)
* [Outstanding](outstanding.md)
