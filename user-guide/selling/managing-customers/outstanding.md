# Outstanding

This page is only available when you enable PrestaShop's B2B features. To do that, go to the "Customer Settings" page, and choose "Yes" for the "Enable B2B mode" option.

This page displays the outstanding report for some of your customers, meaning the amount of money you are allowing them to buy your products before they have to actually pay you.

## Enabling the Outstanding feature <a href="#outstanding-enablingtheoutstandingfeature" id="outstanding-enablingtheoutstandingfeature"></a>

When the B2B mode is enabled (Shop Parameters > Customers Setting page), three fields are added to the customer creation form:

* **Allowed outstanding amount**. The maximum amount of money this customer can use as an outstanding.
* **Maximum number of payment days**. The maximum number of days the customer can go before having to pay his outstanding.
* **Risk rating**. The risk factor for this customer: None, Low, Medium or High. It is up to you to decide if a customer is a risky benefactor of your outstanding feature, or if he will assuredly pay on time.

You should fill these fields for all professional customers.

## Current outstanding screen <a href="#outstanding-currentoutstandingscreen" id="outstanding-currentoutstandingscreen"></a>

Once a customer with outstanding allowance buys from your shop, it appears in the Customers > Outstanding page. This enables you to get an overview of your current outstanding invoices.
