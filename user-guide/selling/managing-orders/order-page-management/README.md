## Understanding the order page organization

Divided into **6 sections**, the page provides you all the details about an order.&#x20;

:arrow\_up: At the **top of the page** is a **quick summary** of the order containing the:&#x20;

* order reference&#x20;
* customerâ€™s name
* total price&#x20;
* date and hour of validation

:arrow\_upper\_left: In the **top left-hand corner**, the **Customer section** gives you information about the customer and the private note, if any. You can even access the customer's personal file to see more details.

* status and status history of the order
* documents related to the order (e.g. invoice, delivery slip, etc.)
* shipping information&#x20;
* merchandise returns

:arrow\_lower\_left: Finally, in **the bottom left-hand corner**, the **Messages section** allows you to send a message to the customer about their order, or leave a private message for your team.
