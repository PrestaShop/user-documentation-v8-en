## **Finding an order** :mag\_right:&#x20;

The orders are organized by date, from newest to oldest.&#x20;

Use the filters at the top of the table to narrow down your search and click on the “Search” button.

## **Exporting an order**&#x20;

You can export a list of your orders. To do that,

* Click on the cog symbol at the top right corner of the Orders section
* Choose “Export”&#x20;

&#x20;Please note that you cannot import orders.

## **Viewing an order’s details**

You can preview an order’s details by clicking on the down arrow, next to the order’s ID. This will display:

* The carrier
* The invoice details
* The products in the cart
* The total amount ****&#x20;

To see more, click on the “Open details” button. This will redirect you to the order details page.&#x20;

You can also access an order directly by clicking on its line on the table, or on the magnifying glass in the “Actions” column.

## **Opening several orders in new tabs**

Save time, by opening several orders in new tabs:

* Select the orders you want to open in the list
* Open the “Bulk actions” drop-down list
* Select  “Open in new tabs”

Do not forget to allow the opening of multiple tabs in your navigator settings.&#x20;

## **Opening the customer page in a new tab**

To open the customer page in a new tab, make a right-click on their name, and click on “Open in a new tab”.

## **Changing the order status**

&#x20;    ****     ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6UrdsTFPXoizMX\_PyjnMDRvnZ7yuqcdqRrboLt3v0W2XXalPe3lTD0Iuv4fbb-mVLzK0alGYtWtMQWmo7W5rlDsl03a42CyJjQgieEvfiV1c9ga1MXtFfiQGgkCLPXd-D9d1-tDa)

On the “Status” column of the table, click on the order’s status and select the new status from the list.&#x20;

Changing the status from the order listing can also be very useful if you want to update the status of several orders. To do that,&#x20;

* Select the orders for which you want to update the status
* Open the “Bulk actions” drop-down list
* Select “Change order status

{% hint style="info" %}
You may have noticed a color change of the order status: you have a good eye! We indeed changed the color for better readability when releasing the 1.7.7 version of PrestaShop.
{% endhint %}

## **Downloading the invoice and delivery slip**

Once an invoice or a delivery slip is generated into the order, it is possible to download it in the action column.

## **Deleting an order**

{% hint style="warning" %}
You cannot delete an order. Implementing a “Delete” button would make PrestaShop illegal in Europe, as it is illegal to remove payment, ordering, or invoice information from a business.
{% endhint %}

If you want to cancel an order, change the order status to “Canceled”. \
